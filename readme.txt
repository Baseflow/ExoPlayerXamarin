Media3 for MAUI (Android)
---------------------------------

Media3 is an application level media player for Android. It provides an alternative to Android’s MediaPlayer API for playing audio and video both locally and over the Internet. 
Media3 supports features not currently supported by Android’s MediaPlayer API, including DASH and SmoothStreaming adaptive playbacks. 
Unlike the MediaPlayer API, Media3 is easy to customize and extend, and can be updated through Play Store application updates.
